# DSCapture.framework

This framework enables you to easily implement screenshot functionality on your Mac OS X applications. It can capture whole screens, or a part of them, make them into NSData and NSImage. There are two ways to capture display.

* Core Graphics: Using Quartz Display Services, screen data goes directly to memory. Fast, but no window selection mode.

* System: Using Mac OS X's screencapture, screen data goes to temp folder `/var/folders` once and loads back to memory. Slow, but great window selection mode.

With the framework, you can choose which one to use. See how below.

# Using the Framework

Check out ScreenCaptureTest application as an example.

Drag & drop `DSCapture.xcodeproj` to your project. Link the framework to your target by adding `DSCapture.framework` in `Build Phases`. Include the header file:

	#import <DSCapture/DSCapture.h> 

At first, you need to make a callback method which has (DSCaptureData *) as a parameter, something like this:

	- (void)displayCaptureData: (DSCaptureData *) sender;

DSCapture is a singleton class - using it is fairly easy. 
To capture fullscreen, you should invoke:

	[[[DSCapture sharedCapture] full] captureWithTarget:self selector:@selector(displayCaptureData:) useCG:NO];

then it will call back the selector right after the capturing process.

To capture selection, you should invoke:

	[[[DSCapture sharedCapture] selection] captureWithTarget:self selector:@selector(displayCaptureData:) useCG:NO];

then it will popup an interface to select, and call back. If the user cancels it, no method will be called back.

At the callback method, you can:

	NSData *data = [sender dataAtIndex:0];
	NSImage *image = [sender imageAtIndex:0];

to get data and image. Also you can call:

	NSUInteger count = [sender count];

to get number of images of the sender. Normally, the number isn't bigger than 1 - except the user is using multiple displays.
